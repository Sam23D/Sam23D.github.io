            <p class="organisms-organism"   >This organism is listed by the American Biological Safety Association as part of the risk group level 2. It is pathogenic in humans and animals, but not in plants. Currently DH5Î± is most often used for routine cloning applications strain.
</p>
            <h2>Bos Taurus (oocytes)</h2>
            <p class="organisms-organism">The most common and cheapest way to obtain oocytes is from slaughterhouse ovaries, so there is ample knowledge of the factors affecting the collection of ovaries. That said, the oocytes of slaughtered animals, represent a viable alternative for the production of embryos, wich can be used to basic research and/or practice of other reproductive technologies. 
It is important to acknowledge that the animals from which the cells of interest  are obtained, are treated with respect and are destined for human consumption.
The lab work only reached the in vitro maturation of bovine oocytes, not fertilization. The technique to follow can be permormed in a variety of growing conditions depending on the environment in which the in vivo oocytes are. To mention an example, the good management of the incubator, the workspace and the sterile conditions where these are handled must be verified.

            <h2>Nicotiana tabacum</h2>
            <p class="organisms-organism">Transgenic plants expressing genes that confer tolerance to herbicides or resistance to insects is currently the subject of controversy in several parts of the world. The debate revolves around the safety that  these plants offer when they are used as food, as well as the long-term ecological consequences of their cultivation. In our case, the specimen that we will use, will not be used for this aim, but to evaluate a new technique of transformation, but still, a risk assessment is needed to verify that the inserted gene doesnÂ´t have any harmful activity such as:

                <li>Allergens</li>

            </ul>
            <p class="organisms-organism">The use of this organism needs careful consideration and following of the rules, restrictions, and requirements for working with GMOs under the law of biosafety of genetically modified organisms issued by the Mexican Government on March 18, 2005.</p>
